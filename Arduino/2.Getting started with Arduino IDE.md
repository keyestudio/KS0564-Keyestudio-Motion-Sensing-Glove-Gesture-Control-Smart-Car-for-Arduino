# Arduino IDE Quick Start

## Installing the Development Software and Driver

### Installing the Arduino IDE (Windows)

Download the latest Arduino IDE: [https://www.arduino.cc/](https://www.arduino.cc/)

Click the SOFTWARE tab at the top of the page:  

![img](./index_img/new(8).png)

Select the version compatible with your computer’s operating system.  

![img](./index_img/new(9).png)

For Windows there are two versions: an installer and a portable (ZIP) version that can be used directly after extraction.  
Click JUST DOWNLOAD to begin the download.

### Installing the Arduino IDE (MAC)

Different operating systems require different Arduino IDE installers.

### NANO PLUS Development Board

![img](./index_img/new(11).png)

The main-control MCU and USB-to-serial chip on this board are the ATMEGA328P-AU and CH340, respectively. Its usage is identical to the Arduino NANO; the only difference is the driver installation method.

It provides 14 digital I/O pins (6 of which can be used as PWM outputs), 8 analog input pins, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a Type-C USB port, an ICSP download header, and a reset button.

The ICSP header is used to flash firmware to the ATMEGA328P-AU via a computer. Power can be supplied through the Type-C USB port or the VIN + GND pins (DC 7–12 V).

The board supports the MCU and can operate via USB power or the VIN + GND (DC 7–12 V) pins.

Pin/part description:

| No. | Pin/Part Name | Description |
| :--: | :-----------: | :---------- |
| 1 | ICSP Header | Consists of MOSI, MISO, SCK, RESET, VCC, and GND—commonly called the SPI interface. Used to flash firmware to the ATMEGA328P-AU when connected to a PC. |
| 2 | LED Indicator (RX) | Serial communication indicator. Flashes when the board is receiving data. |
| 3 | LED Indicator (TX) | Serial communication indicator. Flashes when the board is sending data. |
| 4 | LED Indicator (POW) | Lights when the board is powered; off otherwise. |
| 5 | LED Indicator (L) | Lights when pin D13 is HIGH; off when LOW. |
| 6 | RX0 (D0) TX1 (D1) D2 – D13 | 14 digital I/O pins, 6 of which support PWM output. These are digital logic input/output pins (0 or 1). |
| 7 | RST | Reset pin; an external button can be connected here. |
| 8 | ATMEGA328P-AU | The “brain” of the board. See the datasheet for details. |
| 9 | Type-C USB | Serves as power input and for uploading sketches to the board. |
| 10 | 3V3 | Provides a 3.3 V output. |
| 11 | REF | Analog reference pin. Allows an external reference voltage (0 V – 5 V) to be set as the upper limit for analog inputs. |
| 12 | A0–A7 | Eight analog input pins. |
| 13 | 5V | 5 V power input/output pin. |
| 14 | GND | Ground pin (negative). |
| 15 | VIN | External power input pin (DC 7–12 V) for the board. |
| 16 | Reset Button | On-board reset button. |
| 17 | CH340 | USB-to-serial chip converting USB signals from the PC to serial signals. |
| 18 | AMS1117 | Regulates external DC 7–12 V down to 5 V to power the board. |

## Installing the Board Driver

**click here to download the Driver: [Download Driver](./Driver/Driver.zip)**

#### Detailed Steps for Windows

Connect the board to your computer with a USB cable.

• Windows 10 usually installs the driver automatically.  
• Windows 7 requires manual installation.

The board uses the CH340 USB-to-serial chip, so install the corresponding driver (file name usb_ch341_3.1.2009.06).

![img](./index_img/new(82).png)

When first connecting the board, click “My Computer” → “Properties” → “Device Manager”:

![img](./index_img/new(14).png)

Click USB Serial, then select “Update driver”.

![img](./index_img/new(15).png)

Select “Browse my computer for driver software”.

![img](./index_img/new(16).png)

Locate the driver folder usb_ch341_3.1.2009.06 on your PC.

![img](./index_img/new(17).png)

After installation a window like the one below will appear.

Click Close, then select the corresponding serial port.

![img](./index_img/new(18).png)

Open “My Computer” → “Properties” → “Device Manager”, then select Ports (PORT):

## Installing Library Files

### What Are Arduino Libraries?

A library is a collection of code that makes it easier to upload programs for various sensors, displays, and modules.

### How to Install a Library?

First, click here to download the library: [Download libraries](libraries/MPU6050.zip)

Then click Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library…  

![img](./index_img/new(26).png)

Select the ZIP file you just downloaded and add the required library.

After a successful install, the message bar will display “Library installed”.

## Gesture-Recognition Glove Expansion Board

This motion-sensing glove expansion board includes a 9 V battery holder, allowing it to be powered independently.

It features on-board UART and I²C communication interfaces, two buttons (D7 and D8), and additional sensor connectors.

Assembly is easy—simply plug in the MPU6050 module and the BT24 Bluetooth module.
