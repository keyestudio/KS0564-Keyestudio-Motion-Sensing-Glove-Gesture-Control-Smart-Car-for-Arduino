## **Introduction**

This motion-sensing glove is developed on the Arduino platform and, together with the MPU6050 six-axis accelerometer module, can recognize multiple directional gestures. Compared with traditional button or toggle operations, gesture control allows you to operate devices at will.

Through the BT24 Bluetooth master module, the glove can connect to a mecanum-wheel car, robotic arm, or biped robot, enabling simple gestures to control car movement, arm gripping, robot walking, and more.

Installation is simple—just snap a few modules together. Additional modules can be connected on the expansion board to achieve richer control functions.

To help you better experience the intelligence and convenience of gesture control, we have prepared multiple Arduino example projects and code. Starting from the basic control principles of the MPU6050 six-axis accelerometer module to complex gesture control, you can easily get started and master the techniques.

## **Features**

1. Powerful functions: can recognize gestures in different directions.  
2. Simple installation: modular assembly with no soldering required.  
3. Strong expandability: expansion board reserves common interfaces for other sensors.  
4. Fundamental programming learning: practice with C language in the Arduino IDE.
